# Canvas Selection Demo

This project showcases a basic interactive canvas, reminiscent of the selection functionality found in design tools like Figma. In this canvas, you can interact with three objects by selecting them either through simple clicks or by employing a selection box – simply click and drag your cursor over the objects to choose them.

## Getting Started

To run this demonstration on your local machine, follow these straightforward steps:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install packages
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```
4. Run the project
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Your web browser will display the canvas demo.

## Usage

### Selecting Objects

You can select objects within the canvas using one of two methods:

1. **Clicking:** To select an object, simply click on it. The selected object will be visibly highlighted.

2. **Selection Box:** For choosing multiple objects simultaneously, click and drag your cursor to create a selection box. Any objects fully or partially enclosed within this selection box will be selected.

### Deselecting Objects

To deselect any selected objects, click anywhere outside the chosen area.
